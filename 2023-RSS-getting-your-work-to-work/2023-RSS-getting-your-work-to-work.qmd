## Talk Structure

1. Replicable vs Reproducible work
2. Reproducible Research
3. Reproducible Teaching 
4. Reproducible Service

. . . 

A combination of theft, anecdotes and commentary.

## Some awesome people this talk is riffing on

# Replication vs Reproducibility

## Replication 

> _Replicable:_ if the experiment were repeated by an independent investigator, you would get slightly different data but would the substative conclusions be the same? 

- In the specific sense, this is the core worry for a statistician! 

- Also used more generally: are results stable to perturbations in population / study design / modelling / analysis? 

- Only real test is to try it. Control risk with shadow and parallel deployment.


## Reproducibility

>_Reproducible:_ given the original raw data and code, can you get all of the results again?


- Reproducible != Correct

- "Code available on request" is the new "Data available on request"

- Reproducible data analysis requires effort, time and skill.


## Reproducibility is not Binary

<br>

> A study is <em>reproducible</em> if <b>you</b> can take <b>the original data and the computer code</b> used to analyze the data and <b>recreate all of the numerical findings</b> from the study.

## What can we do?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- __Replication crisis requires system level solutions and cultural change.__ 
   - Publishing null results
   - Documenting our forking paths
   - Fund replications and novelty
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
- __Reproducibility we can work on at individual level.__ 
  - All the standard coding stuff: seeds, projects, portable file paths
  - Who, what, when, where, why and how? 
:::

Reproducibility is __good for science__ and __good for the individual__.

# Research 

## Sharing Code and Data

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="47.5%"}

Publicly sharing code as well as data: importance of documentation & testing. 

## Literate Programming for Papers

## Writing Software

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}
- _Why:_ People have finite energy. Make it easy to recreate, use and extend your work.
- _Who:_ Specialists in other areas, statisticians, future you.
- _Examples:_ spatial statistics, changepoints and HMMs.

# Teaching 

## Teaching Materials

Teaching materials made with literate programming or WYWIWYG:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Text-based so plays nicely with version control
- Multiple outputs from same source (html, pdf, slides)
- DRY principle for assessments
- Leading by example

## Individualised Assessments

Steal from reproducible reporting to give each student their own dataset to analyse and produce individualised mark schemes. 

```{r}

## Teaching reproducibility {.smaller}

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Training current / future colleges. 


- Good programmes cover reproducible modelling
  - Need to consider reproducible _workflow_
  - Data acquisition, cleaning, documentation, naming, reporting, automation, scaling.


- Notebooks controlled environment but more need for scripting and literate reporting.
  - HARD because of the mix of languages / OS / backgrounds.

# Service 

## Reproducibilty in the broder sense 

Can also take a broader view of reproducibility: monotonous jobs you have to do repeatedly that take a long time to do. 

<br>

__From my experience:__

-  *Scripting:* File organisation and LMS. 
-  *Individual:* Individual feedback forms from rubric spreadsheet. (!)

## Wrapping up 

1. Replication requires structural and cultural change, but reproducibility starts with you.
2. Reproducibility is not just good science, it's in your own self interest.
3. Teaching reproducibility reproducibly is essential (and fun), but challenging.
4. Get inventive with automation and reproducibility.

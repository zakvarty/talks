### Abstract

This talk will provide a whirlwind introduction to the core topics in statistical hazard modelling. 

I'm giving you the best bits of a five week course in just 30 minutes. That means this is going to be fast. Don't worry about understanding every detail. The point of this talk is simply for you to become aware of some foundational results/models in hazard modelling. 

Towards the end of the talk I'll allude to some ways we can add non-stationarity into these models and to point you towards resources that you can use to explore these ideas at your own pace. 

- why do we care about hazard modelling?
- risk vs hazard
- from OLS to EVT
- ETT and UETT
- GEV for block maxima
- GPD for peaks over threshold 
- adding in non-stationarity "GLM-style"
- Poisson point processes
- relaxations of the Poisson model
- bringing it all back together
- resources to get started on your own

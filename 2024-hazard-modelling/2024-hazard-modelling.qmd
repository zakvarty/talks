## Risk vs Hazard 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
<br>

**Hazard $\approx$ probability:** _the chance of an event at least as severe as some value happening within in a given space-time window._ 

<br>

$$\Pr(X > x) = 1 - F_X(x).$$
<br>

**Risk $\approx$ cost:** _the potential economic, social and environmental consequences of perilous events that may occur in a specified period of time or space._

$$ \text{VaR}_\alpha (X) = F_X^{-1}(\alpha) \quad or \quad \text{ES}_\alpha(X) = \mathbb{E}[X | X < \text{VaR}_\alpha(X)].$$

## We can focus on modelling large values

Depending on the peril we are considering, the definition of a "bad" outcome differs:

- the largest negative returns in finance,
- the largest positive amounts of rain,
- the smallest failure stress/time in engineering.

. . . 

<br>

Without loss of generality, we can focus on modelling large positive values, by transforming our data and results as appropriate. 

$$g(X_i) \quad \text{e.g.} \quad -X \quad \text{or} \quad X^{-1}.$$


## What is wrong with OLS? 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
<br> <br>

An issue with risk / hazard modelling is that we are by definition interested in the rare events, which make up only a very small proportion of our data. 

- Standard modelling techniques describe the expected outcome.
- Each point is weighted equally and typical values are most common and so dominate measures of model fit.

## Robust Regression and Quantile Regression 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
*Robust regression:*

  - Models the conditional median $Y_{0.5} \ |\  X$. 
  - Reduces sensitivity to "outliers" 
  - The opposite of what we want to do! 
   
Generalises to *quantile regression:* 

  - Model for conditional quantile $Y_p \ | \ X$
  - Okay in sample but sample not always large enough.

## Extreme Value Theory 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
What if we need to do beyond the historical record? 

- e.g. estimate a _1 in 1000-year flood_ from 50 years of data.

- Extreme Value Theory allows principled extrapolation beyond the range of the observed data. 
  - Return values and return periods.

- Focuses on the most extreme observations. 
  - bulk vs tail of distribution.

If we care about

<br>

$$M_n = \max \{X_1, \ldots, X_n\}$$

<br>

How can we model

<br>

\begin{align*}
F_{M_n}(x) &= \Pr(X_1 \leq x,\ \ldots, \ X_n \leq x)  \\
           &= \Pr(X \leq x) ^n \\
           &= F_X(x)^n?
\end{align*}

## Extremal Types Theorem 


Analogue of CLT for Sample Maxima. Let's revisit the CLT:

<br>

> Suppose $X_1, X_2, X_3, \ldots,$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$. 
>
> As $n \rightarrow \infty$, the random variables $\frac{\sqrt{n} (\bar{X}_n - \mu)}{\sigma}$ converge in distribution to a standard normal distribution. 
>
> <br>
>
> $$ \frac{\sqrt{n} (\bar{X}_n - \mu)}{\sigma} \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{N}(0,1).$$

<br>

. . . 

Rephrasing this as the partial sums rather than partial means: 

$$\frac{S_n}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} - \frac{\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{N}(0,1).$$

## Extremal Types Theorem 

Analogue of CLT for Sample Maxima. Let's revisit the CLT:

<br>

Under weak conditions on $F_X$ and where appropriate sequences of constants $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ exist: 

$$a_n S_n - b_n \overset{d}{\longrightarrow} \mathcal{N}(0,1).$$

. . . 

<br>

- Does not depend on $F_X(x)$, subject to weak conditions (mean exists and finite variance).
- Scaling and shifting to avoid degeneracy.
- Motivates Gaussian errors as sum of many non-Gaussian errors.
- Generalises to non-iid sequences. 


## Extremal Types Theorem 

<br>

>If suitable sequences of normalising constants exist, then as $n \rightarrow \infty$: 
>
>\begin{equation} \label{eqn:lit_extremes_normalising}
>	\Pr\left(\frac{M_n - b_n}{a_n} \leq x \right) \rightarrow G(x),
>\end{equation}
>
>where $G$ is distribution function of a Fr√©chet, Gumbel or negative Weibull random variable. 

<br>

This links to the concept of _Maximal Domain of Attraction_: if we know $F_X(x)$ then we can identify $G(x)$.

. . . 

<br>

But we don't know $F$!

## Unified Extremal Types Theorem

These distributional forms are united in a single parameterisation by the Unified Extremal Types Theorem.  

>The resulting generalised extreme value (GEV) family of distribution functions has the form 
>
>\begin{equation} \label{eqn:lit_extremes_GEV}
>	G(x) = \exp\left\{ -\left[ 1 + \xi \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right]_{+}^{-1/\xi}\right\},
>\end{equation}
>
>where $x_+ = \max(x,0)$, $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and $\mu , \xi \in \mathbb{R}$. The parameters $\mu, \sigma$ and $\xi$ have respective interpretations as location, scale and shape parameters. 

-  $\xi > 0$ correspond to a Fr\'echet distribution and a heavy upper tail.
-  $\xi = 0$ the GEV is equivalent to a Gumbel distribution and has an exponential upper tail.
- $\xi < 0$ correspond to a negative Weibull distribution, which is light tailed and has a finite upper end point.

## GEV in Action 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="35%"}
- CLT and UETT are asymptotic results, we use them as approximations for finite $n$.

- Split the data into $m$ blocks of length $k$ and model the $M_k$.

- _How to pick the block size?_ Trade-off between bias and variance. 

- Annual blocks often uses as a pragmatic choice to handle seasonal trends.

## Peaks Over Threshold Modelling

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="35%"}
<br>

- Alternative definition of "extreme": any $X_i > u$. 
- Generalised Pareto limit distribution for $X_i - u \ | \ X_i > u$.
- In applications need to pick threshold $u$.
- To undo conditioning, we also model $\lambda_u = \Pr(X_i > u)$.

## Adding in Non-stationarity 

- IID assumption is overly restrictive
- Asymptotic theory holds for stationary sequences, long as dependence decays "fast enough".
- We can consider GLM style modelling using covariates. 


<br>

$$X_i - u | X_i > u, z_i \sim \text{GPD}(\sigma(z_i),\  \xi(z_i)).$$
<br>

$$ \lambda(z_i) = \Pr(X_i > u | z_i) = \frac{\exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 z_i\}}{1 + \exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1 z_i\}}.$$

## Point Processes

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
EVT gives us a model for the size of rare events, to get risk maps or forecasts we also care about how they occur over time/space.

<br>

_Point processes_ are a stochastic process $\{X_1, \ldots ,X_N\}$ where RVs represent locations of event in time or space and the number of these is random. 

<br>

_Poisson process_ is simplest version, Poisson($\lambda$) number events located independently and uniformly at random.

hpp_1 <- sim_hpp_unit_square(lambda = 20, seed = 1236)
plot_point_pattern_square(hpp_1)
```
:::

## Homogeneous Poisson Processes 

- Not a useful model, too simple to be realistic.

- Central case from which to define clustered or regular occurrences.

```{r load-point-patterns}
cells_path <- "./data/cells.csv"
pines_path <- "./data/black_pines.csv"
redwoods_path <- "./data/redwood_seedlings.csv"

cells <- readr::read_csv(cells_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
pines <- readr::read_csv(pines_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
redwoods <- readr::read_csv(redwoods_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
```

```{r plot-example-point-patterns}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| label: fig-cells-pines-redwoods
#| fig-cap: 
#|   - Locations of 42 cell centres in a unit square .
#|   - Locations of 65 Japanese black pine saplings in a square of side 5.7 m . 
#|   - Locations of 62 redwood seedlings in a square of side 23 m.

plot_point_pattern_square(cells)
plot_point_pattern_square(pines)
plot_point_pattern_square(redwoods)
```


## Testing for CSR 

```{r simulate-point-patterns}
#| echo: false
hpp_1 <- sim_hpp_unit_square(lambda = 20, seed = 1236)
hpp_2 <- sim_hpp_unit_square(lambda = 20, seed = 1235)
hpp_3 <- sim_hpp_unit_square(lambda = 20, seed = 12345)
```

<br>

Some simulated point patterns - which is random, clustered or repulsive?

<br>

```{r plot-example-point-patterns}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 3
#| label: fig-sim-point-patterns
#| subfig-cap: 
#|   - a
#|   - b 
#|   - c.
plot_point_pattern_square(hpp_1)
plot_point_pattern_square(hpp_2)
plot_point_pattern_square(hpp_3)
```

. . . 

Humans are rubbish at this. How can we formally test instead?

## Relaxing the assumptions 

_Inhomogeneous Poisson Process:_ event count still Poisson, events locations still independent but rate of events allowed to vary over time/space: 

$$ \lambda(t) = \lim_{\delta \rightarrow 0 } \frac{N(t, t + \delta)}{\delta}.$$

. . . 

The expected number of events in a region $A$ is given by the integral of this intensity function. 

$$ \Lambda(A) = \int_A \lambda(t) \mathrm{d}t \quad  \text{e.g.} \quad \int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \exp(a + bt) \mathrm{d}t.$$

. . .

Interested in describing the number, location and any additional information about events ‚Äì potentially using covariates to do so.

. . . 

**Further relaxations:** renewal processes, Poisson cluster processes, self-exciting processes.

## All together now 

_Peaks Over Threshold_

  - conditional model for the size perilous events,
  - makes efficient use of the available data.

_Point Processes_

  - joint description of how many perils and where / when we expect to see them. 

Combining these we can undo the conditioning to assess hazard and risk.

*hazard*: number, location and magnitude of peril.
*risk*: convolution of hazard with context and opinion.

. . . 

**Challenge:** What if we do not have a good guess at GLM form? Mix with flexible regression techniques.

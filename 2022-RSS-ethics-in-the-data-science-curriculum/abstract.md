# Incorporating Ethics into the Data Science Curriculum

## Abstract

Data-driven decision making is now pervasive and impacts us all. Your data is used by others to make decisions about who you are, how you will behave, and what options should be made available to you. Predictive models are used to decide anything from the promotion offered to you by a retailer through to whether your loan application is granted. 

The ways in which these predictive models can fail mathematically form a core part of the training for an aspiring statistician or data scientist. In contrast, the potential for _ethical_ failures in these same models is rarely covered in-depth during as part of this initial training. As a result, these modes of failure are often not considered until models have been put into production and are actively causing harm. We argue that to prevent this harm, the ethical impacts of using data to make decisions must be made core to the curriculum of statistics and data science. 

This talk will describe how this may be done while appealing to an audience with a strong mathematical focus and without requiring extended essays or moral treaties to be authored. The discussion is structured around the development of a post-graduate course in the Ethics of Data Science, but the core ideas are salient to all statistics training. Throughout, we give actionable ways in which these topics can be integrated into existing statistics courses at all levels.

### Abstract

This session will explore the impact that personal tutoring can have on both students and staff. We will examine how personal tutoring influences academic success, student well-being, and staff-student relationships by summarising two studies covering the effectiveness of tutoring programs, their benefits and challenges for both students and staff.

The session aims to spark a discussion on best practices and potential improvements in the tutoring system and how it might be optimised to ensure a positive, supportive and sustainable system for everyone involved.
